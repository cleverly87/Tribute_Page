    <h3 id="headline">The Infamous 'Pre' taken all too early</h3>
    <p> Steve Prefontaine known as 'Pre' in his University days died at the age of 24. Even at this age had achieved so much more than what any asteemed runner could hope to achieve. This was at a time when running was at a transition period in the eyes of the world. Pre would become the face of long distance purely on charachter and his dog-minded mentality towards racing.

It was this mentality that drew myself to him along with many others. Pre was known for his awe inspiring quotes in "No one will ever win a 5,000 meter race by running an easy first two miles. Not against me." This was followed by "I am going to work so that it's a pure guts race. In the end, if it is, I'm the only one that can win it".

These quotes were not empty for a man that was already decorated with 7 American Records from in an incredible array of distances:
      <ul>
        <li>2,000 meters - 5:01</li>
        <li>3,000 meters - 7:42</li>
        <li>2 mile - 8:18</li>
        <li>3 mile - 12:51</li>
        <li>5,000 meters - 13:21</li>
        <li>6 mile - 26:41</li>
        <li>10,000 meters - 27:43</li>
    </ul>
    This does not list his own American records that he broke on several occasions. His talent when further than this. He was the NCAA cross country champion 3 years out of 4 and the NCAA track and field champion 4 years running for the 5,000 meters and on one of these occasions the no longer run 3 mile.</p>

   <p> Steve's only intention to go the state <a href ="https://www.uoregon.edu/" target="_blank">University of Oregon</a> was guided by the presence of one Bill Bowerman who later became a founding member of <a href="https://purpose.nike.com/bill-bowerman" target="_blank">Nike</a>, but from what can be gathered was that Bill learnt as much from Pre as Pre did from Bill in regards to the way he ran. Pre was a regular of Hayward Field which has since become iconic around the athletic community around the world because of Pre.</p>
    <p> There is now an annual event in recognition of Steve known as the <a id="tribute-link" href="https://preclassic.runnerspace.com/" target ="_blank">'Prefontaine Classic'</a> this event is an invite only and deems to live in memory of Pre in that his style of running is expected at this rememberance in promise of fast and unexpected races. This is certainly of the most anticpated race meets of the year</p>
